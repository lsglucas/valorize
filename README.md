<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üìë About The Project

This project was develop during [_NLW 06_](#about-nlw). It's main objective was to create a simple but complete back-end api while learning about NodeJS, and related [technologies](#built-with). Valorize makes it possible for you to recognize and appreciate your colleagues ‚ô• through an JWT token authentication, type of compliment using tags, and finally you can send a compliment with a tag and message to another registered user.  
Apart from all of that features I have added Sentry for capture and report errors, and the Swagger UI for easier tests and endpoints documentation.

### About NLW

[_NLW_](nextlevelweek.com) is a brazilian event created by [Rocket Seat](https://rocketseat.com.br) in which you can learn a lot and deep dive into your chosen topic, and everything for free!
I recommend this event for anyone that speaks Portuguese and want to learn tech, read more in [nextlevelweek.com](nextlevelweek.com).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üíª Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

After running the development server you just need to open the Swagger UI, every possible _(in progress)_ request and required params, etc are documented there.
